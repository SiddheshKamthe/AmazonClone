Here's a short description you can add to your README:

This project is an Amazon clone built using HTML and CSS, designed to replicate the basic structure and layout of the Amazon website. I created this clone by following a tutorial on YouTube to better understand web development practices and enhance my front-end skills. The project includes features like a navigation bar, product listing, footer, and basic styling to resemble the original website’s user interface. It’s a simple static webpage and doesn't include backend functionality or interactive elements. This project helped me learn more about layout design, responsiveness, and CSS styling techniques.
